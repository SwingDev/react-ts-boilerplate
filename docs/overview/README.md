### Modern tech stack

React TS Boilerplate provides latest, industry-standard technology stack. Working with this boilerplate, means

* coding in [React][react], backed by [TypeScript][typescript] and [CSS Modules][cssmodules]
* Linting with [TSLint][tslint] and [Stylelint][stylelint]
* Testing with [Jest][jest]
* Bundling with [Webpack][webpack]

More details you can find in [Development](../development).

### JavaScript that scales

React TS Boilerplate may be similar to other boilerplates, but it has one main advantage over competition - [TypeScript][typescript].

> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

Writing in TypeScript means more types and less bugs. This boilerplate heavily uses TypeScript with React to provide developer-friendly environment for building robust and scalable modern front-end applications.
